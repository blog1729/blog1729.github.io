<ul>
<li><strong>Agreegate demand</strong> is the total amount of goods demanded in the economy. One can write aggregate demand as <span class="math inline">\(AD = C+I+G+NX\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is consumption, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is investment, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is government spending and <span class="math inline">\(NX\)</span> is net exports.</li>
<li>At equilibrium level, the quantity of output produces is equal to the aggregate demand, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(Y=AD\)</span>.</li>
<li>When aggregate demand—the amount people want to buy—is not equal to the output, there is <em>unplanned inventory investment</em> or dis-investment. We call <span class="math inline">\(IU = Y-AD\)</span> is the unplanned additions to the inventory. Clearly, if output is greater than aggregate demand the value of <span class="math inline">\(IU\)</span> is greater than zero and vice-versa. If excess inventories accumulates, the firms cuts down on production until the aggregate demand and output is equal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consumption-function-and-aggregate-demand">Consumption function and Aggregate demand</h2>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between <em>consumption and income</em> is described by <strong>consumption function</strong>.</li>
<li>We assume that the consumption demand increases with the level of income and hence the equation <span class="math inline">\(C=\bar{C} + cY\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{C}&gt;0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;c&lt;1\)</span>.</li>
<li>The variable <span class="math inline">\(\bar{C}\)</span> is the intercept and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the slope. The remaining fraction, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(1-c\)</span> is saved.</li>
<li>The coefficient <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is called <strong>marginal propensity to consume</strong> and <span class="math inline">\(1-c\)</span> is called <strong>marginal propensity to save</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consumption-aggregate-demand-and-autonomous-spending">Consumption, aggregate demand, and autonomous spending</h2>
<ul>
<li>We assume that investment is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{I}\)</span>, government spending is <span class="math inline">\(\bar{G}\)</span>, taxes are <span class="math inline">\(\bar{TA}\)</span>, transfers are <span class="math inline">\(\bar{TR}\)</span>, and net exports are <span class="math inline">\(\bar{NX}\)</span>. The <em>consumption now depends upon disposable income</em>. Thus</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
YD &amp; = Y - TA + TR \\
C &amp; = \bar{C} + cYD = \bar{C}+c(Y+TR-TA)
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate demand is the sum of consumption function <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, Investment, government spending and net exports.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
AD &amp; = C+ I + G + NX \\
&amp;= [\bar{C}-c(\bar{TA}-\bar{TR}) + \bar{I} + \bar{G} + \bar{NX}] + cY \\
&amp;= \bar{A}+cY
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Here <span class="math inline">\(\bar{A}\)</span> is independent of the level of income, i.e., autonomous. We also refer this as <em>autonomous spending</em>. (<em>Note:</em> here <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> does not represent income, rather, it is investment.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="formula-for-equilibrium-condition">Formula for equilibrium condition</h2>
<h3 id="equilibrium-output">Equilibrium output</h3>
<ul>
<li>At equilibrium, <em>the output is equal to the aggregate demand</em>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(Y= AD\)</span> and we denote the value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> at equilibrium as <span class="math inline">\(Y_0\)</span>. One can easily show that <span class="math inline">\(Y_0 = \frac{1}{1-c} \bar{A}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is the marginal propensity to consume.</li>
<li><em>We see that the equilibrium level of output is higher, when the marginal propensity to consume is higher and also when the autonomous spending is higher.</em></li>
<li>The book says that the change in autonomous spending and the change in output can be equated by the following relation <span class="math inline">\(\Delta Y = \frac{1}{1-c} \Delta{\bar{A}}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="saving-and-investment">Saving and Investment</h3>
<ul>
<li>When there is <em>no government</em> and <em>no foreign trade</em>, <em>in equilibrium, planned investment is equal to savings</em>.</li>
<li><p>The above statement can also be phrased in the following way, when there is no government or foreign investment, income is either spent or saved, <span class="math inline">\(Y = C + S\)</span>. Also the aggregate demand is equal to Consumption plus Investment, <span class="math inline">\(Y = C + I\)</span>, which implies that <span class="math inline">\(I = S\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If we include government and foreign trade, then income can either be saved, spent or used to pay taxes and hence <span class="math inline">\(Y = C + S + TA - TR\)</span> and complete aggregate demand is <span class="math inline">\(Y = C + I + G + NX\)</span> (the National Income accounting). Thus, we see that:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
C + I + G + NX &amp; = C + S + TA - TR \\
I &amp; = S + (TA-TR-G) + NX \\
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The term <span class="math inline">\((TA-TR-G)\)</span> is called budget surplus and it’s negative is called budget deficit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiplier">Multiplier</h2>
<ul>
<li>One can show that the equilibrium output changes when the autonomous aggregate demand increases by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> unit and that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta AD = \frac1{1-c} \Delta \bar{A} = \Delta Y_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>The <strong>multiplier</strong> is the amount by which equilibrium output changes when autonomous aggregate demand increases by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> unit.</li>
<li>We use the Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to denote multiplier, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \frac{1}{1-c}\)</span>, one can see that <em>the larger the marginal propensity to consume, larger the value of multiplier.</em></li>
<li>Multiplier is useful is developing an explanation of fluctuations of output.</li>
<li>The multiplier suggests that output changes when autonomous spending (including investment) changes and the change in output can be larger than the change in autonomous spending.</li>
<li>The textbook mentions that multiplier is necessarily greater than one in a very simplified model (the model we are studying), but there do exist cases where the multiplier is less than one.</li>
</ul>
